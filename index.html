                    <h2>Wonderful sitcom <br> filled with love, friendship, tears, and laughter</h2>
                    <p>Fuller House is an American sitcom and the sequel to the 1987-1995 television series Full House. It centers around D.J. Tanner-Fuller, a veterinarian and widowed mother of three sons, whose sister Stephanie and best friend Kimmy—along with her teenage daughter—live together at the Tanners' childhood home in San Francisco, California. Danny Tanner, D.J.'s father, raised his daughters with his two friends after his wife died in Full House, the original series. Like Full House, D.J. raises her sons with Stephanie and Kimmy. These three women help each other and find each happiness.</p>

                <h3>Why do I love Fuller House?</h3>
                    <p>Fuller House has many attractive characters, including the three main characters and the people around them. I love every character, even though he/she is a villain. In addition, almost all the characters are acted by the same actors as the original series, which makes Fuller House more attractive to me, because I watched the original series Full House when I was a little child in Japan. I enjoyed Full House from the child's point of view, I can enjoy Fuller House from the parent's point of view.</p>

                    <h3>Is there Michelle?</h3>
                    <p>As previously stated, most of the original series ensemble cast have reprised their roles on Fuller House, either as regular cast members or in guest appearances. However, only D.J.'s youngest sister, Michelle doesn't appear in Fuller House because the actors (Michelle was portrayed by twins Mary-Kate Olsen and Ashley Olsen) already retired. </p>

                    <h3>Connection with Japan</h3>
                    <p>The original series, Full House, is popular in Japan because the Japanese dub version was broadcasted in Japan. In Fuller House, the main characters are dubbed by the same voice actors as in the original series like the English version. There is an episode in which D.J. and her family went to Japan in Fuller House.</p>
